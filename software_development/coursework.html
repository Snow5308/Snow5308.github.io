            <h2>CS 314: Software Engineering</h2>
            <img src="../img/cs314.png" alt="CS 314 Project Page.">
            <p>
                CS 314, Software Engineering, was the first course I took that had the format of a single semester-long 
                project, where students worked in groups to complete the tasks. The project that the course focused on 
                was a trip planner with the goal of providing users with the shortest possible trip given a list of destinations. 
                While programming was a large portion of the course, it was not the main point. Instead, it provided an introduction 
                to various tools and techniques that software developers need to know outside of programming. 
            </p>
            <p>
                On the technical side of the course, <dfn>version control systems</dfn>, primarily <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> and 
                <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, were taught. Version control systems enable version control, which 
                <cite><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control">Atlassian</a></cite> defines as “... the practice of tracking and managing changes to 
                software code.” Previous course projects were small in scale and complexity, so version control was not needed. 
                This course introduced a large-scale project that also involved multiple contributors, so some manner of version 
                control was necessary to keep all the modifications organized. The course also enforced the usage of GitHub best 
                practices to ensure students got practice with proper GitHub etiquette. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Several non-technical skills were also taught. In particular, <dfn>agile development</dfn> practices, such as <dfn><a href="https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-scrum-module">Scrum</a></dfn>, 
                were used. Agile development is a particular method of developing software that allows for changes in requirements to 
                be quickly addressed in order to deliver a functional solution, according to 
                <cite><a href="https://www.opentext.com/what-is/agile-development#:~:text=Agile%20development%20is%20a%20project,interactions%20over%20processes%20and%20tools.">Opentext</a></cite>. Scrum 
                was the agile methodology used, which <cite><a href="https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-scrum-module">Scrum</a></cite> mentions being focused on a Scrum team with 
                each member being responsible for different portions of the project’s development. While providing a structure for development, 
                Scrum also provided a structure for teamwork, which had not been a point of note in previous courses. Of course, other courses 
                had group projects, but this was the first course to truly require teamwork in order to be successful.
