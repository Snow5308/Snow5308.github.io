            <h1>Software Development</h1>
            <p>
                Software development was my introduction to the computer science field, with an introductory 
                course in high school setting me off down the path of computers and technology. This was one of 
                the few courses that I genuinely enjoyed, and I found myself considering a career in the field 
                of software development due to my enjoyment of programming. Courses in college reinforced this 
                desire by introducing me to more complicated software projects and better programming techniques.
            </p>
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                My journey with software development can be split into three main categories: high school, early 
                college, and late college. In high school, the focus was more on basic concepts of programming, 
                using languages like <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a>, which are more visual in 
                nature, to allow students to easily understand what they are doing. At this time, I wanted a more 
                robust and complicated language to work with, as I thought that learning a harder language first 
                would make understanding languages that are more simplistic easier in the future, and I sought to 
                teach myself C++ in my free time. This resulted in me having a basic grasp of programming as I 
                entered college.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once I was in college, the courses formalized my understanding of many of the concepts I had 
                previously encountered using languages like <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> and 
                <a href="https://isocpp.org/">C++</a>. I was also introduced to the concept of data structures, 
                but this did not sink in until later in my college experience. Later in college, I was introduced 
                to algorithms and given more advanced projects that required real-world applications of the technical 
                skills I had acquired from my past education. These projects helped me to fully grasp the concepts that 
                I had been practicing for the past several years and introduced me to many new tools that I still use.

            </p>
            <h2>Coursework</h2>
            <p>
                While courses early in my education were important and taught foundational information, the courses 
                that had the most impact came towards the end of my college education. These courses were taught in a 
                team-driven approach, where teams of four to five students would be grouped together to complete 
                semester-long projects. These courses focused less on the actual programming languages themselves and 
                focused more on the development of a software project. Previous courses had taught how to use tools like 
                programming languages, but later courses taught how to make something with the tools, like a simple web 
                application. This shift in direction was interesting, and it provided an environment to demonstrate all 
                the technical skills that had been practiced in previous courses.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first of these courses was <a href="https://www.cs.colostate.edu/~cs314/">CS 314, Software Engineering</a>. In this course, the main focus 
                was getting students used to common practices employed in software development roles, such as agile development, 
                clean coding, and version control systems. It was also my first introduction to working with a team on a 
                substantial project, so teamwork skills were developed. <a href="https://www.cs.colostate.edu/~cs415/">CS 415, Software Testing</a>, came next.
                 This course had a similar structure to CS 314, but with an emphasis on testing. Many of the previous courses 
                 I had taken needed little to no testing of the software in order to be successful, so learning how to properly 
                 test code was a valuable skill to practice. Finally, <a href="https://www.cs.colostate.edu/~cs414/">CS 414, Object Oriented Design</a> built on the 
                 previous two courses while drawing attention to how to plan and design software prior to its production. In many 
                 courses, simply jumping into the code was sufficient to complete the projects that were given, so taking a step back 
                 from coding to work on how to design good software was a unique experience.
