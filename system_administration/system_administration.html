            <h1>System Administration</h1>
            <p>
                Many of the courses I have taken have neglected the topic of system administration, 
                so it has been a personal interest and hobby of mine. Over the years, I have developed 
                a small home lab, a small server system designed for home use, which I use for tinkering, 
                learning, and hosting a handful of services.
            </p>
            <h2>Server History</h2>
            <p>
                Around the time that I started getting interested in software development, I also started getting interested in 
                servers and what they could do. From this, I started looking into what I wanted to do with the limited hardware 
                at my disposal, an old Compaq computer. After putting a hard drive in it and getting a flash drive with <a href="https://www.truenas.com/freenas/">FreeNAS</a>, 
                I started my system administration journey. 
            </p>
            <p>
                After getting started with a network-attached storage (<abbr>NAS</abbr>) system, I started learning virtual machines, and 
                eventually got better hardware. I soon started working with <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/en/">Proxmox</a> which hosted a NAS and acted as a hypervisor. 
                At the time, I lacked knowledge of containers, so most of my dealings were with virtual machines. I now have 
                a better grasp of containers, and I have started migrating most of my services away from their virtual machine based solutions.

            </p>
            <h2>Server Setup</h2>
            <p>
                At the moment, I have two computers running <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/en/">Proxmox</a> in a cluster, five Raspberry Pi computers running <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/">Docker Swarm</a>, 
                and a desktop running a <a href="https://www.pfsense.org/">pfSense</a> firewall. These devices are connected by a 24-port switch, and wifi is provided 
                by a router that has been repurposed into an access point. Due to computers being fairly expensive, most of these 
                parts are used or older.
            </p>
            <p>
                When it comes to the software that these machines run, I have <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/en/">Proxmox</a> as my preferred hypervisor, <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> as my 
                preferred operating system (<abbr>OS</abbr>), <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/">Docker Swarm</a> for the firewall, and Docker for containers. <a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> was more convenient 
                for the Raspberry Pi computers, so they run a <href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> as their OS.
                <br>

            </p>
            <h2>Technologies</h2>
            <p>
                The virtualization technologies that I use in my homelab include <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/en/">Proxmox</a>, <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>, and <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/">Docker Swarm</a>. <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/en/">Proxmox</a> is 
                installed on my servers to host any virtual machines that I need, while <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> is hosted in a virtual machine to 
                provide any containers that I need. The Raspberry Pi computers are running <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/">Docker Swarm</a> to allow me to learn more 
                about container orchestration.
            </p>
            <p>
                My preferred operating system is <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>, and most virtual machines that I run are installed with <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> as the OS. 
                I have worked with other operating systems as well, including <a href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch</a> and <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/">Fedora</a>, but these are more for particular 
                use cases rather than general usage. For my firewall, <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/">Docker Swarm</a> is the OS, and for the servers themselves, the OS is 
                <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/en/">Proxmox</a>. The Raspberry Pi computers run a <href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>, but this is a derivative of <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>.
