            <h2>Operating Systems</h2>
            <p>
                Operating systems (<abbr>OS</abbr>) are the software that make a computer usable, and some examples are Windows and the 
                various distributions of Linux. In my homelab, most of the machines run some distribution of Linux. 
                <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/en/">Proxmox</a> is used on my servers, and <cite>Proxmox</cite> claims to be based on Debian, 
                a Linux distribution. For virtual machines, I primarily use <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> when possible, but I 
                have tried other distributions like <a href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch</a> and <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/">Fedora</a>. 
                For my Raspberry Pi computers, <a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> is used due to its convenience. The one outlier for my 
                usage of Linux-based operating systems is my firewall, which uses the FreeBSD-based 
                <cite><a href="https://www.pfsense.org/">pfSense</a></cite>.
            </p>
            <h2>Virtualization</h2>
            <p>
                <dfn>Virtualization</dfn> is a huge component of working with servers, as it allows for one computer to run multiple operating 
                systems, essentially multiple computers, on one physical machine. <dfn>Virtual machines</dfn> make up one of the main forms of 
                virtualization, which are entire other guest computers run on a host computer via emulated hardware. <dfn>Containers</dfn> are 
                another form of virtualization, and they work by having an environment like an OS that utilizes the host OS to make containers 
                significantly less resource-intensive than virtual machines.
            </p>
            <p>
                For my virtual machine needs, I use Proxmox as my hypervisor. <dfn>Hypervisors</dfn> 
                are the software that enable the creation, management, and usage of virtual machines. Proxmox is rich in useful features, such 
                as LXC container management, virtual machine management, storage pool creation, and clustering, which is why I have felt no need 
                to try other hypervisors.
            </p>
            <p>
                For containerization, I use <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> because it is popular and has a large number of 
                containers to choose from on <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">Docker Hub</a>. Docker is interacted with exclusively by 
                the command line, so I use a <a href="https://www.portainer.io/">Portainer</a> container run on Docker to give my Docker 
                setup a pleasant graphical user interface (<abbr>GUI</abbr>).
