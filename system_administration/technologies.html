            <h1>Technologies</h1>
            <p>
                Various technologies are utilized in my home lab environment, and more technologies are planned to be used in the future.
            </p>
            <h2>Operating Systems</h2>
            <p>
                Operating systems (<abbr>OS</abbr>) are the software that make a computer usable, and some examples are Windows and the 
                various distributions of Linux. In my homelab, most of the machines run some distribution of Linux. 
                <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/en/">Proxmox</a> is used on my servers, and <cite>Proxmox</cite> claims to be based on Debian, 
                a Linux distribution. For virtual machines, I primarily use <a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> when possible, but I 
                have tried other distributions like <a href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch</a> and <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/">Fedora</a>. 
                For my Raspberry Pi computers, <a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> is used due to its convenience. The one outlier for my 
                usage of Linux-based operating systems is my firewall, which uses the FreeBSD-based 
                <cite><a href="https://www.pfsense.org/">pfSense</a></cite>.
            </p>
            <h2 id="virtualization">Virtualization</h2>
            <p>
                <dfn>Virtualization</dfn> is a huge component of working with servers, as it allows for one computer to run multiple operating 
                systems, essentially multiple computers, on one physical machine. <dfn>Virtual machines</dfn> make up one of the main forms of 
                virtualization, which are entire other guest computers run on a host computer via emulated hardware. <dfn>Containers</dfn> are 
                another form of virtualization, and they work by having an environment like an OS that utilizes the host OS to make containers 
                significantly less resource-intensive than virtual machines.
            </p>
            <p>
                For my virtual machine needs, I use Proxmox as my hypervisor. <dfn>Hypervisors</dfn> 
                are the software that enable the creation, management, and usage of virtual machines. Proxmox is rich in useful features, such 
                as LXC container management, virtual machine management, storage pool creation, and clustering, which is why I have felt no need 
                to try other hypervisors.
            </p>
            <p>
                For containerization, I use <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> because it is popular and has a large number of 
                containers to choose from on <a href="https://hub.docker.com/">Docker Hub</a>. Docker is interacted with exclusively by 
                the command line, so I use a <a href="https://www.portainer.io/">Portainer</a> container run on Docker to give my Docker 
                setup a pleasant graphical user interface (<abbr>GUI</abbr>). 
            </p>
            <h2>Clusters</h2>
            <p>
                At the moment, two different clustering technologies are used in my homelab, Proxmox clustering and 
                <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/">Docker Swarm</a>. <dfn>Clustering</dfn> computers means 
                multiple machines can interact and share resources or information to work together. 
            </p>
            <p>
                For Proxmox, clustering allows both of my servers to communicate, which includes several nice features. 
                This is mainly a convenience, as the primary benefits is being able to control both servers with one login 
                rather than having to log in to both machines individually. However, it also allows for virtual machines to 
                be migrated from one machine to another with ease, which allows for better resource management. Docker Swarm 
                acts similarly to a Proxmox cluster in the manner that it distributes containers across the cluster to use the 
                available resources.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am also looking into setting up <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> and 
                <a href="https://hadoop.apache.org/">Hadoop</a> clusters. With Kubernetes, I am hoping to learn a different container 
                orchestration platform and the technologies that come with it. Hadoop is a technology I have been interested in since my 
                <a href="https://www.cs.colostate.edu/~csx55/">Distributed Systems</a> course, and I hope to gain more practice with this 
                technology.
