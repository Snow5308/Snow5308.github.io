                My home network consists of two distinct sections: an area that allows users a typical home environment, and a 
                more secure area that allows access to services provided by my servers. Nothing much of note happens with the 
                regular section of the network, so it will not be discussed. Most of my homelab resides within the secured 
                section, as it needs higher levels of security.
            </p>
            <p>
                What makes this area more secure is that it is behind a <a href="https://www.pfsense.org/">pfSense</a> firewall. 
                The firewall blocks malicious and unwanted network connections. Within the secured area, there is a WIFI access point 
                that allows users to connect to the secured area and access content that is inaccessible in the unsecured section. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The servers, named Ruby and Yang, provide most of the services, with Ruby being the primary server. The main service 
                that Ruby provides is a <abbr>NAS</abbr>, or <dfn>network attached storage</dfn>, which allows users to store and access 
                files on the server from their personal computer. I keep most of my files on this machine, and I frequently back up files 
                here. Several other services are available on Ruby, such as <a href="https://pi-hole.net/">Pi-hole</a> to filter ads, and 
                a <a href="https://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> database server. Yang, on the other hand, provides fewer services and is mostly 
                used to back up the data on Ruby, in case the data is corrupted or wrongly deleted. Data stored on both servers is kept in a 
                <dfn>RAID6 storage pool</dfn>, which means that multiple storage drives are used in combination, and up to two of these drives 
                can fail without damage to the data occurring.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, there is also a set of five Raspberry Pi Computers. These machines are kept mainly for learning, and are expendable 
                as they do not host any major services. This way, I can experiment with new software and clustering without worrying about 
                taking down an important service.
            </p>
            <h2>Software Setup</h2>
            <figure>
                <img src="/img/Software_Diagram.drawio.png" alt="Software diagram showing how the software interacts in the homelab.">

            <p>
                Primarily, the servers Ruby and Yang host the most important services. Both Ruby and Yang run the <dfn>hypervisor</dfn> 
                <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/en/"></a>Proxmox, which means they are able to host multiple computers on one machine by 
                emulating the needed hardware. They are also clustered together, so access and communication between the servers is simplified. 
                Most services are hosted on a <dfn>virtual machine</dfn>, an emulated computer, on Ruby that runs 
                <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>. This Docker instance is managed by another virtual machine on Yang that is running 
                <a href="https://www.portainer.io/">Portainer</a>. Outside of the virtual machines, Ruby also provides the NAS, and Yang provides 
                backup services by pulling the data to its own storage pool from Rubyâ€™s NAS.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Raspberry Pi computers are not doing much at the moment, but I plan to cluster them and use them for learning specific 
                technologies that I am interested in. <a href="https://hadoop.apache.org/">Hadoop</a> and 
                <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> are the two main plans I have for the Raspberry Pi computers, with Hadoop being 
                focused on distributed data analytics, and Kubernetes being focused on container orchestration.
