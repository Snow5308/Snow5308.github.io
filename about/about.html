            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                I am Connor Ramey, an aspiring software developer. Ever since I was a child, I have been interested in computers, 
                with most of my interest stemming from my love of video games. However, as I started taking more computer science 
                classes, I found a passion for programming, and I quickly decided that software development was the career I wanted 
                to pursue. This led me to start learning languages in my free time, primarily C++. Once I got to college, it was 
                clear that computer science would be my major, and I spent the next several years formalizing my understanding of 
                the basic concepts of programming. During this time, I graduated from Pikes Peak Community College, now Pikes Peak 
                State College, with my associate degree. I then attended Colorado State University, where I studied more advanced 
                concepts in programming, and Java quickly became my language of choice. I hope to graduate this December with my bachelorâ€™s 
                degree.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my free time, I have a small home lab setup that allows me to provide some services for my family and learn topics 
                that I am not taught in class. While this setup is by no means meant to be a professional setup, it has taught me many 
                system administration skills that I frequently use when maintaining the servers. I also taught myself Python and have 
                been practicing leetcode problems to help my problem-solving.
            </p>
