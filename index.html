                <h2>Site Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    Primarily, the goal of this site is to provide a summary of the skills I have acquired through both 
                    education and personal projects in the computer science field. As computer science has been an interest 
                    of mine for many years, compiling all I know on the subject would be unreasonable, so, instead, the two 
                    areas I am most interested in, software development and system administration, have been included. 
                    Detailed explanations of the topics will be provided to explain what skills I gained along with the 
                    reasons I took particular routes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A secondary goal of this site is to provide a starting point for those interested in computer science. 
                    Many of the topics discussed will be an overview of the topic, so interested individuals can further 
                    pursue the topic should they wish. Further, discussions on the different available technologies will be 
                    provided to allow people to make decisions on which routes they may want to take in learning more about 
                    computers.

                    Software development is one of the foundational topics of computer science, and my journey with the topic 
                    started many years ago. Over those years, both formal and informal education have led to my proficiency in 
                    the area, but there are still areas that I am learning about.

                <p>
                    Unlike my experience with software development, my system administration journey has been mostly through 
                    personal projects, and it is one of my main areas of interest. Over the years, I have built, rebuilt, maintained, 
                    broken, and repaired various computers in a home lab environment, and I have learned a great deal about system 
                    administration from trying new things out.
