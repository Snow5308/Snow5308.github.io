                    Through both education and personal projects, I have acquired a variety of technical skills. A summary of these skills has 
                    been provided, with system administration and software development being the two areas I am most interested in.

                    Software development is one of the foundational topics of computer science, and my journey with the topic 
                    started many years ago. Over those years, both formal and informal education have led to my proficiency in 
                    the area, but there are still areas that I am learning about.

                <p>
                    Unlike my experience with software development, my system administration journey has been mostly through 
                    personal projects, and it is one of my main areas of interest. Over the years, I have built, rebuilt, maintained, 
                    broken, and repaired various computers in a home lab environment, and I have learned a great deal about system 
                    administration from trying new things out.
