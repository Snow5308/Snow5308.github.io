            <h2>Site Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Primarily, the goal of this site is to provide a summary of the skills I have acquired through both 
                education and personal projects in the computer science field. As computer science has been an interest 
                of mine for many years, compiling all I know on the subject would be unreasonable, so, instead, the two 
                areas I am most interested in, software development and system administration, have been included. 
                Detailed explanations of the topics will be provided to explain what skills I gained along with the 
                reasons I took particular routes.
            </p>
            <p>
                A secondary goal of this site is to provide a starting point for those interested in computer science. 
                Many of the topics discussed will be an overview of the topic, so interested individuals can further 
                pursue the topic should they wish. Further, discussions on the different available technologies will be 
                provided to allow people to make decisions on which routes they may want to take in learning more about 
                computers.
